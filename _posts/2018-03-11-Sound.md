# Sound in Digital Humanities Work 

## Listening to Data

In reading about the possibilities of sound in the digital humanites one of the interesting points that I had yet to think about was that sound, and specifically music, has the ability to alter moods. As demonstrated by Brian Foo, the sonfication of data can have a an immediate sensory impact that might not otherwise be present in other forms of visual representation, although thats not to say that vizualizations do not have an impact as well. In the case of Foo's sonification of [Beijng Air Quality] (https://datadrivendj.com/) a collection of important, but otherwise emotionally uninspiring data, is turned into a song that produces an emotional effect in the listener. As an example, a cluster of days with bad air quality produced a sense of impending danger while a period of good air quality created a feeling  of relative calm. While I might be shocked to see data about climate change, the auditory representation has a temporal quality and is accompanied by sensory stimulation that I feel make sound a really interesting aspect of dh work. 

In addition, one of the consequeces of transforming data into sound, as pointed out by Tanya Clement in ["The Ground Truth of DH Text Mining Debates"](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/96), is that researchers have to address questions of who's ear they will be constructing and to whom they will be making things audible. In claiming that sound is aporatic, Clement seems to hint at the fact that researchers need to be more reflexive about the decisions they make regarding how data is represented. While this reflexivity also takes place in vizualization practices, the challenges of sonfication seem to require that additional thought be given to the position of the researcher in determining what is meaningful and relevant. 

### The Sound of the Past

One of the areas that I feel sonfication has the potential to generate significant interest in is history. In addition to the interesting work done in mapping and vizualition, sonfication can add another level of information to the study of the past. Whether it be the sonic word clouds of [Daniel Ruten](https://programminghistorian.org/posts/sonic-word-clouds) or the soundscape of [Emily Thompson and Scott Mahoy](http://vectors.usc.edu/projects/index.php?project=98&thread=AuthorsStatement), sound brings a new dimension to investigating and coming to understand the past. In a nutshell I feel it helps to make us aware of things we might otherwise not consider relevant.
