## A Closer Look at Social Media 

### The Individual 

When a person creates an account on twitter or Facebook it is safe to say that they are at least partially aware that what they are creating represents who they are as a human being. When they post a photo, tweet, or make a comment they are presenting an element of their identity or personality to an audience. While a lot of the content that ends up getting posted to both Twitter or Facebook appears trivial, or to use the language of Erving Goffman, represents ‘back-stage’ behavior, it is nevertheless carefully selected. Similar to the way people cultivate a front for the audiences they encounter in face-to-face interaction, the presentation of a front in a digital space requires a careful selection of traits to be conveyed. Even if the content that gets posted appears trivial it reflects what the individual wants others to know about them and serves as a basis for understanding who they are. In the event that teenagers, or anyone else for that matter, doesn't recognize their potential audience, the information can serve to compromise their 'identity' and raises questions about the nature of privacy in online spaces.

In contrast to face-to-face interaction, the computer mediated interactions typically seen on social media take place in time rather than in a physical space. The physical co-presence required in face-to-face interaction is no longer required but at the same time we also lose some of the subtle nuances of communication. While there are many ways of conveying emotion in CMC for example, the lack of simultaneous monitoring limits the knowledge a user can have of other participants mood, tone, smell, etc.… While this does not limit or prevent meaningful communication and interaction in online spaces it is worth remembering as it points to some of the differences between CMC and face-to-face interaction. 

### Youth and Privacy 

As noted by danah boyd and Alice Marwick in “Social Privacy in Networked Publics: Teens’ Attitudes, Practices, and Strategies” (2011), there is a difference between the way privacy has traditionally be conceived of and the way teens now think about their own privacy. As I mentioned above, some of the content that tends to get posted can be characterized as belonging to the ‘backstage’ which may appear like a disregard for personal privacy. However, what is important remember here is the amount of time spent thinking about posts and the control a user has over what they post. What’s interesting though is the capacity for a post or tweet to be re-embedded into another user’s network. In the case of twitter this can be done through a retweet but in a more general sense the content of any post can be captured by another user through copying it or taking a screen shot. In general, privacy seems to be less about the content that gets posted and more about the context that the content is viewed in.

 It should also be noted that while the average user is more concerned about which users can see their content, not enough attention is given to the personal information available in the form of ‘raw’ data. [Martin Hawksey](https://mashe.hawksey.info/2016/06/tags-tricks-making-a-searchable-location-map-of-your-top-twitter-contributors-with-geocode-by-awesome-table/amp/) offers an example of this by pointing out that nearly 20% of tweets contain data about the exact location of the user. What seems most problematic about this is that by agreeing to twitter’s terms or Facebook’s for that matter, we sacrifice elements of our privacy without being fully aware of it. 

### Propaganda 

Reflecting on Kris Shafer’s [techniques for combating propaganda](https://pushpullfork.com/getting-started-fighting-internet-propaganda/#annotations:rtNSsvyDEeeZLR9mQpWP3A), one of the things that I found myself thinking about was how to address propaganda in educational contexts. As with many skills, recognizing and challenging disinformation and misinformation in digital contexts is closely related to literacy. Digital literacy in this case, is a critical component of safely navigating and interacting with content online. As it stands, there isn’t a lot of attention given to digital literacy in secondary education which results in less confident and critical citizens. One of the ways we can improve digital literacy without major changes to education is to incorporate critical digital literacy activities into ELA and history classes. Learning to recognize bias in both historical writing and in different literary genres offers a starting point for doing the same in digital contexts. Complimenting this practice would be the discussion of ‘authentic’ and reliable sources and how to ‘fact’ check questionable sources. As a kind of foundation, this knowledge would ideally help to produce a more critically engaged population with many of the skills used in classrooms being transferable to real life experiences. For furthering reading on digital literacy, [MediaSmart’s](http://mediasmarts.ca/) website has some valuable information relating to youth and digital citizenship.
