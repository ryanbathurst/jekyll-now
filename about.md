## A Word About Myself

I am a Carleton University Graduate Student in the Department of Anthropology and Sociology with a specialization in the Digital Humanities. My background is in education, having completed by Bachelors degree at McGill University in Secondary Education. Having had the opportunity to work as an ELA teacher in Quebec, I'm now turning my attention to world of the digital humanites. This blog will serve as a space to share thoughts, reflect, and explore what it means engage with work in the digital world.
